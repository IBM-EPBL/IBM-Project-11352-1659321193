## Description:

Crude oil is a yellow-black naturally occurring liquid found in geological formations beneath the Earth's surface, it 
can be separated into various kinds of consumer fuels through the process of fractional distillation. 

Crude oil is amongst the most important energy resources on earth right now. So far, it remains the worldâ€™s leading fuel, with 
nearly one-third of global energy consumption. Petroleum products are also made of refined crude oil. 
Encouraging usage of fossil fuels is getting highly unpopular as they're irrefutably responsible for global warming, and other 
severe impacts on ecosystems. 

A conscious effort to phase-out fossil fuels is being made throughout the world 
to act upon the climate crisis. Petroleum is of utmost importance to industries, individuals,etc and oil price forecasts are 
very useful to industries,governments and individuals. Although many methods have been developed for predicting oil prices, 
it remains one of the most challenging forecasting problems due to the high volatility of oil prices.
